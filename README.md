Stock Market VBA Analysis

This challenge is to loop through stock data to analyze the data for each stock in each year provided. It displays the stocks that had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume.

1. The ticker symbol.
2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total volume of the stock for that year
